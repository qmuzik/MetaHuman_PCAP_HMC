MetaHuman PCAP HMC GoPro Notes Version 1.0

- Pretty tight on head, might need to find a bigger size or different model to allow more comfortability
during shoots.

- Counterweight pouch with all weights inside make a HUGE difference in comfortability when using the 
iPhone for recording faces. 

- Need to fiddle with Chin strap to make it more comfortable.

- Need to find a chin guard for the strap so it sits more solid on the chin instead of sliding, but it cannot block too much of the front of the chin. 

- Might need to get more padding inside the helmet to make it more comfortable. 

- NVG mount and arms work PERFECT. However, I want to find a way to mount them on the side of the helmet
instead of the top. 

- Might need to get lights on the helmet arms or mounts to brighten up the face which allow better facial 
capture results.

- Definitely going to keep using HSU for camera parts. Might not hurt to look into double arm mounting 
for better stability.
