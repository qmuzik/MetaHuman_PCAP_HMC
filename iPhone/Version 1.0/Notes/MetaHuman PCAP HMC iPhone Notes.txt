MetaHuman PCAP HMC iPhone Notes Version 1.0

- Unreal Live Link iPhone app will definitely make it easier to capture facial movements.

- Definitely heavier in front with the iPhone configuration while the GoPro is lighter. 

- Directional mic or lavalier might be needed for better audio quality. 

- Might prefer the GoPro over the iPhone due to weight, but still need to test it in UE.

- If I decide to get a directional mic for better audio, I am going to need a cage with a hot shoe 
mount for a light. However this will increase weight and could cause neck strain.
