MetaHuman PCAP HMC GoPro Notes Version 1.0

- Having the HMC be able to use a GoPro and iPhone for facial capture was a smart move.

- GoPro is definitely lighter and would not need as much weight in its counter weight pouch.

- Going to need a directional mic or lavalier to get better audio quality.

- Due to past HMC designs have the GoPro use a vertical orientation would result in better results. This
would be due to removing excess footage on the sides of the actors face and allow more precise focus on the
face. 

- Due to GoPro's size, I definitely need to use the small aluminum arm to get the camera in the proper 
position of the actors face. 

- Might have to figure out how to give continuous power for the GoPro to prevent battery changes.
